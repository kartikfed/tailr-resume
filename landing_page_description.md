# Detailed Description for a Landing Page

**(Headline)**
### Stop Blending In. Start Standing Out.

**(Sub-headline)**
### Tailr is your personal AI career stylist, crafting perfectly fitted resumes that land interviews. In a sea of generic applications, we make sure yours is the one they can't ignore.

**(Section 1: The Problem)**
### Your Resume is Your First Impression. Make it Count.

The average recruiter spends just **7 seconds** scanning a resume. In that time, they're not just looking for experience; they're looking for a perfect match. A generic, one-size-fits-all resume rarely makes the cut. It speaks to no one because it tries to speak to everyone. The result? Your qualifications get overlooked, and your application ends up in the "no" pile.
